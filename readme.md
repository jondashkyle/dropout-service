<h1 align="center">dropout-service</h1>

An easily self-deployable microservice for nabbing data from [`dropout`](https://github.com/jondashkyle/dropout) when youâ€™re client side. [Fork me on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/melodic-comfort?path=index.js:1:0)!

## usage

`git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/dropout-service.git`

[`dropout-beaker`](https://github.com/jondashkyle/dropout-beaker) uses [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/melodic-comfort?path=index.js:1:0) to host an instance of this, which you can fork to easily spin up your own instance. Since you can only run client side within Beaker, we fetch the result from there and write the received data to JSON within the siteâ€™s Dat archive.

## features

- Basically nothing ðŸŽ‰

`POST` at `/` with a `url` in the form data to receive data which looks something like this:

```

  "basename": "171029-anticapitalist-human-scale-software-",
  "content": "<main><p>Twitter launches features no one wants. Parse shuts down. Websites track us to an astonishing degree. Corporations close down open systems. They turn over our data to the government.</p>\n<p>Software and services that are supposed to make life better are becoming unreliable and untrustworthy. It is increasingly clear that our interests, as software-using humans, are diverging from the interests of software companies.</p></main>",
